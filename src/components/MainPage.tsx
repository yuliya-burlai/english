                  <p className="card-text">
                    While I have the classic combo of MA in English, a non-degree year of studying in the USA plus CELTA, I consider my experience with other languages just as important. At some point in my life I learned & dropped German & Chinese but continued learning & using French, Spanish & Polish.

                    10+ years of own experience as an English speaker in business & IT, also working as a corporate soft skill trainer, gave me the perspective of how English is a tool, not a goal.

                  <p className="card-text">
                    I encourage people to explore how English can be something they enjoy so much, they just want to use it all the time. Learning a new language is like meeting a new person, your new English-speaking identity. I will help you nurture that new confidence while keeping tabs on how to save your effort for this new marathon you'll be running for as long as English is part of your life.
