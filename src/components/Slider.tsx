                        <p>Julia is THE teacher, who makes you smile, laugh, enjoy and make learning fun. Her contagious smile itself helps you relax and rely üòÑ That's a blessing to find such an experienced and kind teacher. I was her student years ago.. nearly 15 years ago, but I still remember how she made me pronounce "th", safe and pleasant atmosphere in our classroom and her countless stories. I do recommend her as a teacher, she'll definitely help you get where you want to be üòâ</p>
